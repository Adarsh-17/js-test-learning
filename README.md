# My Testing Library

This is a simple testing library and example usage for JavaScript projects. It includes custom `expect` and `test` functions to perform basic testing without using a full-fledged testing framework.

## Explanation

- **`expect(result)`**: A custom function to assert that the `result` matches the `expected` value.
- **`test(title, callback)`**: A custom function to run the test cases. It logs a checkmark if the test passes or an error if it fails.

## CLI Tool

A CLI tool is planned to search for all test files and run them using `npm` and Node.js. The implementation of this CLI tool is remaining.
